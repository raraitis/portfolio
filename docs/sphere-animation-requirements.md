# Sphere Animation Requirements

## Visual Concept
A clean **3D sphere moving organically under the Saturn gradient background** - simple, elegant, and subtle.

## Key Design Elements

### 1. 3D Sphere Effect
- **Visibility**: Subtle but clearly visible under the background gradient
- **3D appearance**: Radial gradient shading to create depth and dimension
- **Organic movement**: Slow, natural orbital motion with subtle pulsing
- **Saturn theme**: Warm beige/tan colors that complement the background

### 2. Animation Behavior
- **Movement**: Slow organic orbital motion (figure-8 like pattern)
- **Pulsing**: Gentle radius variation for life-like feel
- **Positioning**: Off-center to create visual interest
- **Layering**: Behind gradient background, clearly "under" the surface

### 3. Interactive Elements
- **Navigation response**: Sphere position updates with dragging interactions
- **Letter scatter response**: Animation store integration for dynamic behavior
- **Subtle feedback**: Visual feedback without being distracting

## Technical Implementation
- Canvas-based rendering for smooth 60fps performance
- Radial gradients for 3D sphere effect with highlight and rim lighting
- Responsive sizing based on screen dimensions
- Saturn color palette integration
- MobX store integration for interactive responses

## Visual Result
- Clean, minimalist 3D sphere
- Organic, hypnotic movement
- Subtle presence that enhances without overwhelming
- Perfect complement to Saturn gradient background
