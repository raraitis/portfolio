              The rhythm of code and the rhythm of running have always been connected for me. Whether I'm debugging a complex algorithm at 2am or pushing through the final kilometers of a triathlon, I've learned that persistence and problem-solving go hand in hand. I've been building with code since I discovered programming, and racing since I could lace up running shoes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              From early morning swim sessions to late-night coding marathons, I thrive on the discipline and focus that both worlds demand. The same mindset that gets me through century bike rides helps me architect scalable applications. The patience learned from long training runs translates perfectly to debugging and iterative development.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              What excites me most is building digital solutions that actually matter - tools that help people achieve their goals, whether that's a training app that helps runners reach their PR, or a business platform that streamlines operations. Like in endurance sports, it's about going the distance and delivering something meaningful.

            This speaks to me both in athletics and in development. Every project starts with that first line of code, every race starts with that first step. The courage to begin something challenging, knowing it will test your limits, is what separates dreamers from doers.
